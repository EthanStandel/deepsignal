# ðŸ“¶ @deepsignal/core

This library is meant to expand on Preact's new `Signal` primitive to make it a viable state management solution at the scale of a full
state management system by wrapping the built in primitive with a new `DeepSignal` model. This package in particular is an extension of
the `@preact/signals-core` package. That is to say that it doesn't provide much utility on its own, but provides the core logic for
`@deepsignal/preact` & `@deepsignal/react`. If you are trying to implement this into an application, then you very likely want one of 
those packages.
